*[GFAAS]: Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy

# Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy

Compared to the flame methods you have used previously, the graphite furnace uses a high voltage power supply to rapidly increase the temperature of a graphite tube, atomizing your sample.

## Prior Reading
Read the application note by Agilent posted on BOLT.

## Procedure

 1. Prepare 100 mL of 50 Âµg/L Pb stock solution from the 1000 mg/L standard solution.
 2. Prepare 50 mL 1% magnesium nitrate solution in 1% HNO~3~.
 3. Prepare the soy sauce unknown by diluting 0.10 g of the soy sauce to 5.0 g using 1% HNO~3~. Mix well.
 4. Work through the method development screens to include the parameters in the application note.
 5. Include the furnace program from the application note.
 6. Ensure the lamp and autosampler are aligned. Your instructor will demonstrate how to do this.
 7. Analyze the unknown for Pb content using both a standard calibration curve and the internal standards method.
 8. Be sure to include a sample with a matrix spike recovery &mdash; contaminate some soy sauce with a known quantity of Pb. Did you get the expected value out?
 
## Options for method development

 - [ ] Determine a more optimal temperature program for our instrument. I noticed that my sample was boiling in the tube which could spatter material on the walls.
 - [ ] Consider the difference(s) between background correction and no background correction.
 - [ ] Consider the removal of or changing the concentration of the chemical modifier.
 - [ ] Perhaps I can scrounge up some palladium nitrate to add that as a chemical modifier, though even the instrument installer noted that there is debate as to whether this common modifier is useful.
 - [ ] We could consider doing a dual analysis (two or more lamps)
 
## Questions
 1. What is the purpose of all of the different steps in the furnace program? You may need to dive into the literature here. Take a look at some of the references in the technical note.
 2. Which method for calibration is more useful in this case &mdash; a standard calibration curve or the standard addition method? Be sure to discuss the pros and cons of each method.
 2. What is the detection limit of Pb for your developed method? Is this better or worse than that of the technical note?
 2. Since we are considering the use of chemical modifiers here, is it possible that other compounds in the soy sauce are modifying our signal? Propose some methods for eliminating these contaminants.
