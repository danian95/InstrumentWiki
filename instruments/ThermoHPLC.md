## Familiarization

### Procedure

 1. The HPLC is a POS, so it should **remain on** all the time. Make sure that
    it's on by noting all of the LEDs on each module (bottom = pump, middle =
    autosampler and column, top = detector).
 2. Open the ChromQuest software and then double-click HPLC. (Not HPLC/man!)
 3. Go to File > Method > Open and find "321Caffeine.met"
 4. On the toolbar, click the icon that says "Single Run". You
    may have to hover the cursor over each icon to find out what each one is.
 5. Name your sample something fun and interesting. Click the folder icon next
    to Method and find "321Caffeine.met" if the correct method is not loaded. Change the data path to
    "C:/Data/Practice". Change the Data file to the Sample ID - Method - Date
    and Time by clicking on the arrow to the right of the field. This allows
    data files to be automatically named based on what you place in here.
 6. Open the autosampler door and inspect the samples available. If you took 321
    last semester, some of the vials may seem familiar! Pick your favorite and
    note its position - you will need a letter and a number. The letter is
    printed on the front of the instrument. The number is on the sample holder.
    You may need to pull the sample holder out to get a better view. Close the
    door.
 7. Under "Autosampler" on the computer, type in your favorite vial in the Vial
    field using the format "Letter;#". So, if I wanted to inject the vial in C3,
    I would type "C;3". Without quotes!
 8. Click start.
 9. As the run starts, you may want to play around with the windows. Click the
    Window menu at the top of the screen to see what options are available to
    you.
10. When the run finishes, you may get some error messages about not being able
    to integrate. Ignore them.

### Questions

 1. What type of detector is this instrument using? Unsure? Take a look at the
    wavelengths being used and consider what region of the electromagnetic
    spectrum that falls under.
 2. You should have noticed that your data was very noisy in the beginning, but
    after your first peak, it became a lot smoother. What happened to all of the
    noise in the beginning?
 3. We're using the mobile phase in position "D". What is this mobile phase?
 4. Were your peaks clearly resolved? If not, what might you be able to do to
    increase the resolution between caffeine and benzoic acid?
