# Perkin Elmer Spectrum 400 IR/NIR

## Familiarization

### Procedure

 1. Make sure the power is on to the spectrometer.
 2. Open the Spectrum IR software and log in as Administrator.
 3. We will be operating the spectrometer in Attenuated Internal Reflectance
    mode. This simplifies our sample preparation significantly because we don't
    have to do any sample preparation! Make sure the sample stage is clear and
    the Accumulations is set to 10 scans. Click Background.
 4. When it's complete, click the dropdown arrown on Scanalyze and then Scan and
    Search. Place the plastic shopping bag on the stage. Keeping an eye on the
    force gauge on the monitor, begin tightening the hammer to hold the sample
    close to the crystal.
 6. Once you have a force of about 100, click Scan.
 7. Allow the software to finish scanning. It will search a library for a compound that matches the spectrum you obtained.
 8. When you are finished, close the software. Do not turn off the spectrometer.
    It generally stays on all the time to reduce humidity inside the instrument.

### Questions

 1. What is the result of the library search?
 2. Does this match the actual material (inspect the bag for a label)?
 3. Using the above procedure, take a look at the underside (the non-label side) of the DVD. What is it made out of?
 4. Do you think we can put this DVD in a computer and it will still work? In
    other words, is this a destructive or a nondestructive technique?
 4. What might happen if you try to analyze a material of mixed composition?
