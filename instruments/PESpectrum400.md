# Perkin Elmer Spectrum 400 IR/NIR

## FT-IR

Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a technique used to obtain an infrared spectrum of absorption or emission of a solid, liquid or gas. An FTIR spectrometer simultaneously collects high-resolution spectral data over a wide spectral range. This confers a significant advantage over a dispersive spectrometer, which measures intensity over a narrow range of wavelengths at a time.

The term Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy originates from the fact that a Fourier transform (a mathematical process) is required to convert the raw data into the actual spectrum.
## Familiarization

### Procedure

 1. Make sure the power is on to the spectrometer.
 2. Open the Spectrum IR software and log in as Administrator.
 3. Locate the dessicator around the FT-IR and find two salt plates (they're kind of hidden in with all of the mess) and place on the bench top on a Kimwipe. 
 4. Clean the salt plates with methylene chloride (or other non-aqueous solvent)
 4.Using a Pasture Pipet place about 2-3 drops of your standard solution between both of the salt plates and record its spectra. There is a special slip for the salt plates and it has a triangular ledge to it to rest the salt plates on. 
 5. Once you have the sample loaded make sure your parameters are set to:
 a. scanning from 600 cm^-1^ - 800 cm^-1^
 b. accumulations: 3 scans
 c. blank has been measured before hand using 0% m/p-xylene solution
 6. you may now begin to run through your samples ensuring that the plates were cleaned with DCM. 
 7. Once the samples have been run through using the salt plates, you may now switch the sample holder to a fixed path length cell. This is hidden in one of the drawers that you are going to have to rummage through... sorry the instrumental lab is a mess. It looks like a **vintage**, black casset tape (do y'all still know what that looks like?) with a clear center and two little spikes sticking out of it to flush the solution through. 
 8. This whole cell goes into the FT-IR so make sure the salt plate ledge has been removed. 
 9. Flush the cell with a needleless syringe with DCM and load to run a new blank with your standard solution . 
 *Ensure that a mL or more of DCM is passed through the cell before introducing new samples.
 *Flushing is not necessay if analyzing a series dilution from low concentration to high concentration as long as enough sample is added to push the previous sample out.
 10. Load your parameters to: 
 a. abscissa units: wave #
 b. ordinate units: A
 c. resolution: 4 cm^-1^
 d: accumulations: 3 scans
 e. start: 800 cm^-1^
 f. end: 600 cm^-1^
 g. scan type: sample
 11. Now one can compare number of scans to background for the last part of the experiment.
 12. Change the parameters at the bottom for a 1 v 1, 10 v 10, and 100 v 100 scans v background. 
 13. Save all data and export to a USB and shut down the software.
