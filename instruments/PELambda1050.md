## Familiarization

UV-Vis-NIR refers to ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared. Ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometers use a light source to illuminate a sample with light across the UV to the visible wavelength range of the electromagnetic spectrum (typically 190 to 900 nm). UV-Vis Spectroscopy (or Spectrophotometry) is a quantitative technique used to measure how much a chemical substance absorbs light. This is done by measuring the intensity of light that passes through a sample with respect to the intensity of light through a reference sample or blank.

### Procedure

  1. Make sure the power is on to the spectrometer (well before the wet prep of your solution samples, duh!). The switch is around the back. 
  2. Open the PerkinElmer UV WinLab software and log in with Analyst.
  3. Open the pre-made method "Scan".
  4. Once "scan" is up and running, perform an auto-zero with absolutely **nothing** in the machine. 
  5. On the left sie of the screen, there is a tab that reads "data collection". This will allow you to see an electronic view of the whole instrument and change individual parameters. 
  6. Set the following parameters:
  a. scan from: 700 nm-300 nm (or other desired wavelength range)
        
       *The first scan should be broad to avoid missing absorbance peaks. Subsequent scans can be performed over smaller wavelength ranges once the absorbance peaks of the analyte are determined.  
  b. The other parameters can be kept at the default settings. 
  7. Now you are ready to run the blank (the primary component(s) of the sample matrix: e.g. DI water) and the samples. Set up a sample method under the sample ID tab... should pop up when you first open the "scan" method. Add your desired amount of samples making sure you include the blank.
  8. Place a two-sided frosted quartz cuvette in the **front** cell holder with your blank first, close the lid, and press the orange triangle to run. 
  9. The instrument will instruct you what sample to place in the cell holder next, so just make sure you're competant enough to follow the directions :).  
  10. Once all of your samples have been run, open "Send to DPV" at the top of the screen. This allows you to see all of your samples over-layed on one another. 
  11. To export all of your data using an excel friendly format: press file > export > .csv. Then save to your desired location on the desktop and drag to your USB.
  12. If you are the last one to use the machine, ensure the program is closed and the instrument is turned off.
