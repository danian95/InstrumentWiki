## Familiarization

### Procedure

  1. Make sure the power is on to the spectrumeter.
  2. Open the PerkinElmer UV WinLab software and log in with Analyst.
  3. This instrument uses "methods". Select the CHEM322 Instrument Familiarization method.
  4. Click Start. The instrument will ask you to remove the samples to perform
     some zeroing (100% and 0%T). Make sure that a **blank** (distilled water)
     is placed in the **front** cuvette holder. Close the lid to the
     spectrometer and click OK when ready.
  5. This will take a while, but when it's ready for your sample it will prompt
     you to insert the sample. There should be a cuvette with purple in it ready
     for you to use.
  6. After all scanning is complete, answer the questions below regarding your
     spectrum before closing the software.
  7. Close the software and, if you're the last one using the instrument today,
     turn it off.

### Questions

  1. There should be two peaks, a fairly shallow one and a not so smooth looking
     one. The sample is actually the UV-Vis waste from CHEM115: Analysis of a
     Synthetic Blood sample. The coloration was provided using a FerroZine
     coloring agent, which binds to iron. Based on the position of the peaks,
     at what wavelength might you quantify blood iron levels? Which of your two
     peaks might be a bit more difficult for quantification and why?
  2. The UV-Vis you used in CHEM321 (and 115/116 depending on your year) is a
     lot faster at aquiring data. For reference, you can see that spectrometer
     on the bench by the double doors. Feel free to drop the sample cuvette in
     to see what the spectrum looks like. What do you think this Lambda 1050 is
     doing that the OceanInsight does not do?
  3. I had you open a method rather than building all of the parameters. What
     benefits might such method-using instruments afford? What might be the
     downsides to loading and using methods like this?
