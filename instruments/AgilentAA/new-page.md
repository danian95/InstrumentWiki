5. Next, select 'Edit Methods...'. 

## Instrument Alignment
1. Adjust the light intensity by removing the autosampler/middle case to expose a double knob.
2. Pull up the light intensity monitor on the AligentAA software to reach the maximum intesity possible to reaach the sample
 	a. To move the compartment deeper in into the instrument or out away from the back of the instrument turn the outer knob.
	b. To move the compartment up or down in the space turn the littler knob that sticks out of the knob as a whole.
  
**NOTE** - You may press the rescale button to rescale the intesity to 1 if the intesity is over the value of 1. 

3. To align the arm on the autosampler first unlock the autosampler by the bottom knob on the attachment. 
3. Press align and then optimize on the software. Also bring up the Furnace Video.
4. The arm will move to the sample cup (position 1) where the draw up tube can be adjusted. 
	a. Loosen the tan plastic knob on the arm.The tube should be able to slide in and out of the arm.  
  b. Adjust the tube so it touches the botton of the cup and then pull up slightly to get optimal solution intake.
  c. Tighten the tan plastic knob
 6. Press okay and the arm will move to the furnace where it will disperse the solution it uptakes.
 7. Adjust the arm to fit into the openein gof the furnace usinf the knobs on the autosampler. 
 	a. use the knob of the right to allow the arm to move into the instrument or back out of the instrument.
  b. use the knob on the front of the autosampler to move the arm to the left and right 
 
 **NOTE** - You need to be able to see the opening to get the tube into the opening so feel free to use the step stool if not tall enough to see it to begin with 
 
 8. Once the arm is adjusted perfectly you should see the tube in the furnace video.
 9. To adjust where the arm and tube are in the furnace use the metal knob (it looks like a screw) to lift the arm up or bring it down so the tube can freely dispense of the solution in the furnace.
 10. To make sure it is going to freely dispense every time lift the arm up manually with your hand, and drop it too see if it goes smoothly into the opening with the metal stopper stopping it at the desired height from the bottom of the graphite tube.
 11. After this is complete lock the autosampler in place by twisting the bottom knob on the instrument. 
 12. Press okay and the instrument alignment is complete.
