## Familiarization

### Procedure

 1. Make sure the power is on to the AA. The furnace portion (the module on the
    left) can remain off.
 2. Open the SpectrAA software.
 3. Click Worksheet.
 4. Click New from...
 5. Select Pb demo and git it a new name that I can easily find and delete
    later.
 6. Click Start on the left of the screen.
 7. The instrument will tell you to ignite the flame. Hold down the flame button on
    the AA until it ignites.
 8. Insert the tubing into the beaker labeled "DI Water" and run the zero.
 9. Swap the tubing for the appropriate standards (1 = 1 ppm, 2 = 3 ppm, 3 = 5
    ppm) as prompted by the computer. Click "Read" when ready to read the
    standard.
10. Make sure to watch the flame for this one! "Present" (as in put the tube in
    the Erlenmeyer flask) the Pb paint sample.
11. Once the run is complete, the flame with automatically shut off. Enjoy the
    pleasant music from the PC indicating that the run is complete.
12. Close the software and turn off the instrument when you are finished with
    the questions below.

### Questions

 1. What was the flame used?
 2. What was the flow rate for the gases used in the flame?
 3. What is the concentration of Pb in the paint sample?
 4. Was your calibration curve linear? If so, what was the slope? If not, is it
    still OK to use your calibration curve? Why?
