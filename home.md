# Welcome
This wiki is a collection of the shared instrumentation available to Bloomsburg University faculty, staff, and students. Each instrument has a dedicated page listing the technical details of the instrument as well as general procedures for operating the instrument.

> This wiki is a **work in progress**. During the Spring 2022 semester, students enrolled in CHEM322: Instrumental Analytical Chemistry will be adding details to the instrument pages as they work in the laboratory.
