*[FOM]: Facility Online Manager

The Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Bloomsburg University requires all students to log instrument hours in an online platform, Facility Online Manager. This helps the department track instrument usage for maintenance and consumable purposes as well as minimize time conflicts between users who would like to use the same instrument at the same time.

At this time, you can go to your User Home page, but it should be empty. You will need to wait until you receive training and appropriate access to the equipment.

# Scheduling Time

Once you have access to your desired instrumentation, you may now schedule time.

1.  Find the desired instrument on your User Home Page.

3.  A "New reservation" window will appear. If you selected a default financial account, it will already be filled in for you. Indicate your expected end time and include a quick description of what you will be doing or what you will be examining.

# Using the Instrument

At your scheduled time you must remember to both log on and log off of the instrument.

> Failure to log on or off will limit your access to the instrument in the future.
{.is-warning}

1.  Open your reservation from the calendar. You will have an option to "Logon" or "Cancel reserved time".

2.  When you are finished using the instrument, open your reservation from the calendar again. There may be "Logoff reminders" that *must* be checked in order to log off from the instrument. You will also have an opportunity to indicate if something was wrong with the instrument. Please make any additional comments as requested by your instructor.
