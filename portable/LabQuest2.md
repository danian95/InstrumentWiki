The LabQuest is capable of measuring many different quantities depending on which probe(s) is/are attached.

# Measurements {.tabset}

## Temperature

1. Attach temperature probe to USB port (upper left side).

2. Turn on power (left upper side) &mdash; The unit should show temperature.

   1. Press **Duration:** and set to 300 s.

   2. Press **Done**.

   3. Press **Rate:** and change to 10 samples/s.

   4. Press **Done**.

3. Set up your experimental run with the temperature probe appropriately positioned.

4. Press ![labquest-run.png](/labquest/labquest-run.png =30x) to start recording the temperature. The display will change to a graph.

    > On your second and subsequent runs, you will get a message about what to do with your previous run. Press **Discard**.
    {.is-info}

5. Allow the temperature to be recorded for about 15 s to be sure you have a flat baseline. Also, *record the initial temperature in your notebook*.

6. Perform a trial run.

7. After the temperature has leveled off for at least 20 s, record the final temperature, then press ![labquest-stop.png](/labquest/labquest-stop.png =20x) to stop recording.

8. Go to Step 3 for subsequent runs.

9. When you have completed the experiment, clean the probe and power off
   the LabQuest.
