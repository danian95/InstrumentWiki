# Reagan's Life 
Here is a little bit about my life outside of school. 
## I have seven family members (counting my dogs, of course)
1. My mom, Kelly
2. My dad, Scott
3. My twin sister, Riley
4. My brother, Cannon
5. My brother, Jackson
6. My 10-year-old dog, Peach
7. My almost 3-year-old dog, Rommi

## In the summer my family loves to be outside
My family is very coompetitive especially in sports, so we take backyard sporting events very serious. 

Our "Summer Olympics" consists of
- Driveway basketball (1v1, 2v2, and 3v3)
- Backyard volleyball (3v3)
- Spikeball (2v2 tournaments)
- Slow Pitch Softball
- Whiffle ball
- Backyard sprint race
